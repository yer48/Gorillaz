                      City's breaking down on a camel's back
                      They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
                      So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
                      You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free
                      You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
                      A melancholy town where we never smile
                      And all I wanna hear is the message beep
                      My dreams, they got a kissing
                      'Cause I don't get sleep, no
                      Windmill, windmill for the land
                      Turn forever hand in hand
                      Take it all in on your stride
                      It is ticking, falling down
                      Love forever, love is freely
                      Turned forever, you and me
                      Windmill, windmill for the land
                      Is everybody in?
                      Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats
                      Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
                      Play these ponies at the track
                      It's my chocolate attack
                      Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)
                      Care Bear rappin' in harder this year (yeah)
                      Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
                      Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
                      With yo' sound, you in the blink
                      Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
                      With yo' sound, you kill the Inc
                      So don't stop, get it, get it (get it)
                      Until you're cheddar headed
                      And watch the way I navigate
                      Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
                      Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good

                      Peep how your captain's in it (sha-ba-da-ca, feel good)
                      Steady, watch me navigate (sha, sha-ba-da)
                      Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha (sha-ba-da-ca, feel good)
